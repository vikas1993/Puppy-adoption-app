<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->
Here i have tried to load the various list of puppies into the list view where it will show type of puppy it's age and many
after clicking on any particular dog it will redirect it to its details page where it will tell dog feature details etc.

<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
I am proud that being very new to jetpack compose i have completed the work by using totally new syntax which i feel very confident about
its working and also used variuos components like navigation component which has made the work very easily to complete.
Also i have tried to learn new state lifecycle for the compose design pattern and yet there are many more new things to learn.
